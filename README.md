#### General requirements
-  The project must be a web application, and requires a frontend, backend, and a database.
-  Git must be used with clear and meaningful commit messages. The repository must show: 
	- Commits from all team members. 
	- Clear commit messages describing the changes. 
	- Proper work distribution across the team
- Deployment must use a containerisation solution (Docker, Podman, or equiva- lent) and run with a single command.
- No warnings or errors should appear in the browser console.
- The project must include accessible Privacy Policy and Terms of Service pages with relevant content.
	- GDPA rules should apply
	- Privacy Policy and Terms of Service: These pages will be verified during evaluation. They must: 
		- Be easily accessible from the application (e.g., footer links). GDPA dictates within 2 clicks
		- Contain relevant and appropriate content for your project.
		- Not be placeholder or empty pages.
	- Missing or inadequate Privacy Policy/Terms of Service pages will result in project rejection
- Multi-user Support (Mandatory): Your website must support multiple users simultaneously. This is a core requirement of the project. Users should be able to interact with the application at the same time without conflicts or performance issues. This includes:
	- Multiple users can be logged in and active at the same time. 
	- Concurrent actions by different users are handled properly. 
	- Real-time updates are reflected across all connected users when applicable. 
	- No data corruption or race conditions occur with simultaneous user actions.
#### Technical requirements
-  A frontend that is clear, responsive, and accessible across all devices. 
- Use a CSS framework or styling solution of your choice (e.g., Tailwind CSS, Bootstrap, Material-UI, Styled Components, etc.).
- Store credentials (API keys, environment variables, etc.) in a local .env file that is ignored by Git, and provide an .env.example file.
- The database must have a clear schema and well-defined relations.
- Your application must have a basic user management system. Users must be able to sign up and log in securely:
	- At minimum: email and password authentication with proper security (hashed passwords, salted, etc.). 
	- Additional authentication methods (OAuth, 2FA, etc.) can be implemented via modules.
- All forms and user inputs must be properly validated in both the frontend and backend.
- For the backend, HTTPS must be used everywhere

> What is a Framework? For this project, a framework is defined as a comprehensive tool that provides: • A structured architecture and conventions for organising code. • Built-in features for common tasks (routing, state management, etc.). • A complete ecosystem of tools and libraries. Examples: • Frontend frameworks: React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Next.js (these are frameworks). • Backend frameworks: Express, Fastify, NestJS, Django, Flask, Ruby on Rails. • Not frameworks: jQuery (library), Lodash (utility library), Axios (HTTP client). Note: React is considered a framework in this context due to its ecosystem and architectural patterns, even though it is technically a library.

### Team Information
csalamit : 
Aternero : 


### Project Management:

### Technical Stack:
frontend : mui / react and axios for api
backend : express , node.js
container : docker and docker compose
nginx for https

### Database Schema



The application uses a single SQLite database (`data/transcendence.db`).

#### Table: `users`

| Field | Type | Constraints | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | INTEGER | PRIMARY KEY, AUTOINCREMENT | Unique user identifier |
| `login` | TEXT | UNIQUE, NOT NULL | 42 login or chosen username |
| `email` | TEXT | UNIQUE | User email address |
| `password_hash` | TEXT | nullable | bcrypt hash (null for OAuth 42 users) |
| `avatar` | TEXT | nullable | URL to user avatar image |
| `wins` | INTEGER | DEFAULT 0 | Number of games won |
| `losses` | INTEGER | DEFAULT 0 | Number of games lost |
| `created_at` | DATETIME | DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP | Account creation date |

#### Notes

- Users authenticated via **OAuth 42** have `password_hash = NULL` and their avatar is fetched from the 42 API.
- Users authenticated via **email/password** have their password stored as a **salted bcrypt hash** (cost factor 12).
- Game state is stored **in memory** during a session and is not persisted to the database.

# INSTRUCTIONS

# RULES OF THE GAME 

Each player have 25 cards
max 4 players
each player have 3 differents atatcks, wallet point and start date 
you can only see your cards and only the one you playing with 
lets say you click on wallet , if you have a bigger wallet than the ooponent you win the round 
when a round is lost you loose your turn 
cards go to the pile then they are given


### TopTrumps 42 (2D)
- [[Top trump rules]]
- There are multiple deck options (we can unlock these through wins).
	- Each Deck consists of the students of that campus in that rank
	- Eg. Starter Deck is Milestone one students in Malaga
		- Next progression is Milestone two in Malaga
		- And so on.
		- Once we have achieved getting all decks in Malaga another campus is unlocked, and we continue with the progression module there
	- The deck gets randomly generated at the start of the game (this makes it more interactive and less predictable with who you will play)
		- also the cards can update, if a student passes to the next milestone they now will be in the next level deck


### Run server

```
node server.js
```

Server runs on: (for now )

## 📌 Overview

This project implements the backend for a **Top Trumps-style card game** as part of the Transcendence project.
Players compete by comparing stats on cards, and the winner collects them.

The backend is built with **Node.js + Express** and integrates with the **42 API** for user data.

---

##  Tech Stack

* Node.js
* Express
* Axios (API calls)
* dotenv (environment variables)
* WebSockets / Socket.io for real-time gameplay

---

##  Authentication

* Uses **42 API (OAuth2)**


---

##  Project Structure

```

---

##  Game Flow

```
1. User logs in (42 API)
2. Create / join game
3. Game starts
4. Cards distributed
5. Player selects stat
6. Cards compared
7. Winner collects cards
8. Repeat until one player wins
```

##  Important Notes

* Do NOT commit `.env`
{

      this will need to be delete before sent 

      :
}
* Token is required for all 42 API calls
* Real-time gameplay will require **WebSockets**
